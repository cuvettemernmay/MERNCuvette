# MERN Cuvette
This repository, "learning-mern-stack," is a personal project focused on exploring the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) through practical examples and tutorials. It serves as a resource for enhancing full-stack development skills.

A. Introduction to Full Stack Development (MERN Stack)
1. Frontend - Client Side - HTML, CSS, JavaScript - (React)
2. Backend - Server Side - Node.js, Express.js - (MERN)
3. Database - MongoDB

B. MEAN Stack
1. MongoDB
2. Express.js
3. Angular
4. Node.js

<!-- Web and HTML -->

A. What is the web/website/webpage?
B. What is HTML? => HTML is a markup language that add the content to the web page.

2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS

Specificity based on the applied order: Inline > Internal > External
Specificity based Id, class, element: Id > Class > Element

Types of Selectors:
1. Element Selector - Tag Name
2. Universal Selector - *
3. Class Selector - .class
4. ID Selector - #id
5. Group Selector - ,
6. Descendant Selector - space
7. Child Selector - >
8. Adjacent Sibling Selector - +
9. General Sibling Selector - ~
10. Attribute Selector - [attribute]
11. Pseudo Class Selector - :hover
12. Pseudo Element Selector - ::before, ::after


<!-- Box Model -->

<!-- HTML Forms: -->

HTML Forms are used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

HTML Forms are a collection of input elements.


<!-- CSS Positions -->

CSS Positions are used to position the elements on the web page.

CSS Positions are of 5 types:
1. Static
2. Relative
3. Absolute
4. Fixed
5. Sticky

Relative:
0. When position property is given as relative, the element is positioned relative to its normal position.
1. Reference of Relative - Static Element Position Edges. 
2. Will not allow the element to overlap other elements.

Absolute:
0. When position property is given as absolute, the element is start floating from the position of the parent element.
1. Reference of Absolute - Parent element (must have position property as relative).

Fixed:
0. When position property is given as fixed, the element is positioned relative to the viewport.
1. Reference of Fixed - Viewport.
